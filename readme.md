As the world is going into lockdown because of the covid-19 pandemic, why not take this opportunity while staying at home to create something for the community and share it with the world!

siQtheme is a responsive admin template created with Bootstrap 4 and using Webpack / Laravel-Mix to bundle the assets. It's best to use it with a packages manager like npm or yarn and pull into your project. However, you can install the theme traditionally by compiling the source into a public build. Webpack is a module bundler primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets like HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included.

## Using siQtheme with Laravel

```

Add to bootstrap.js file in resources directory

``` bash
require('siqtheme');
```

Import styles to app.scss

``` bash
@import '~siqtheme/src/assets/sass/siqtheme';
```

Create a new view file (i.e. test.blade.php) and copy the content from the sample.html:

```
node_modules/siqtheme/src/sample.html
```

Replace the stylesheet link and script in your new file with the correct link and script for your application.

``` bash
# replace this line to point to your style
<link href="assets/css/app.css" rel="stylesheet">

# replace this line to point to your script
<script src="assets/scripts/app.js"></script>
```

Add a new route

``` bash
Route::get('/test', function() {
	return view('test');
});
```
